# Prediction of the Swedish stock market using supervised learning (deep neural network - LSTM)
This program was part of my bachelor thesis where I tried to predict the Swedish stock value with the help of the long short-term memory, which is a deep neural network method. I have many Python files on this repo because I tried many methods before choosing one method that it seemed right to me. Sadly I do not remember the people who wrote many of this tutorials or blogs so if you know, please let me know so I can add their names here :).

Some references that it seems like it has been part of some of my programs:

## What I have learned on this project
I started to understand the strenght to use machine learning for data analysis and also many of the weakness of machine learning. I learned many of the processes that is is important for data analysis such as: choosing the data, learning the data, cleaning the data, analysing the data, creating a neural network and choosing the right method for the job.

I also learned how to program a long short-term memory and ARIMA.

A few subjects that I had to go through during this project:
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Neurons
- Layers
- Activation functions
- Accuracy and Loss
- Optimizers
- Validation
- Training
- Etc.
## What could be better
The result probably was overfitting since the analysis with the test data had over 90% of accuracy. Sometime I will come back to this project and check if I can add other tests to check accuracy one more time.
