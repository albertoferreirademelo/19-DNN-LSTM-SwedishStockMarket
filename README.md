# Prediction of the Swedish stock market using supervised learning (deep neural network - LSTM)
This program was part of my bachelor thesis where I tried to predict the Swedish stock value with the help of the long short-term memory, which is a deep neural network method. I have many Python files on this repo because I tried many methods before choosing one method that it seemed right to me. Sadly I do not remember the people who wrote many of this tutorials or blogs so if you know, please let me know so I can add their names here :).

## What I have learned on this project
I started to understand the strenght to use machine learning for data analysis and also many of the weakness of machine learning. I learned many of the processes that is is important for data analysis such as: choosing the data, learning the data, cleaning the data, analysing the data, creating a neural network and choosing the right method for the job.

I also learned how to program a long short-term memory and ARIMA.

## What could be better
The data probably overfitted since the result had over 90% of accuracy which in my opinion is way too high.
